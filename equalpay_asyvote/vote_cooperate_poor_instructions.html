        In this part, you and your three group members start with a vote. <br>
        Each of you are endowed with one share. <b>But you can buy more shares with a cost of {{ C.COST_VOTING }} per share to have more influence on the voting stage. </b> <br>
        Your purchase cannot exceed your earning in Part I. <br>
        You and your group members collectively decide which game(Game A or Game B) your group will play for 10 rounds in part II. Game A is the game you played in part I and Game B is similar but with different payoffs:

        <h3>
            Vote Stage
        </h3>
    <p>
        In the vote stage, you need to
        <ol>
        <li>choose the amount of additional shares you want to buy;</li>
        <li>decide which game you vote for.</li>
    </ol>
    After all of you make decisions, which game is implemented depends on two rules:
        <ul>
        <li>Firstly, the vote result is based on the majority rule. That is, if over half of shares vote for game A, then game A wins.</li>
        <li>Secondly, your group decision is taken into consideration with a 50% chance. For example, if your group decides game A, but your group decision is not taken into account, the computer will randomly choose a game for you. In that case, you don't need to pay for your additional shares.</li>
        </ul>
    You will be informed about the voting results after you make your own vote decision and click the next button.
