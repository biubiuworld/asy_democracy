            Vote Stage
        </h3>
    <p>
        In the vote stage, you need to decide which game you vote for. After all of you make decisions, which game is implemented depends on two rules:
        <ul>
        <li>Firstly, the vote result is based on the majority rule. That is, if three of you choose game A, then game A wins.</li>
        <li>Secondly, your group decision is taken into consideration with a 50% chance. For example, if your group decides game A, but your group decision is not taken into account, the computer will randomly choose a game for you.</li>
        </ul>
    You will be informed about the voting results after you make your own vote decision and click the next button.
